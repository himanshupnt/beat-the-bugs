===============================

To install (run) the game, download this repository from [https://github.com/himanshupnt/beat-the-bugs](https://github.com/himanshupnt/beat-the-bugs). Open the index.html file to run it on your browser.

To play the game, press Enter. Reach the blue water without colliding with the bugs to win. Use left-right-up-down
keys to move your character in the game. New level starts when you successfully reach the water.


Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
